Linear Regression was not a good model for this dataset because there are too many features.  Logistic Regression handled things better because, at it's core, this is a classification problem.  If I had more time I would have used a Deep Learning algorithm and possibly a neural network.  These two moddels, with their itterative processes may be a better fit for this complex dataset.
